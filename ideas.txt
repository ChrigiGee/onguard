----[ ide serial number - NOT SATA or SCSI ]-----------------
I am using the following code to get the hard disk serial number

struct hd_driveid hd;
int ide;
ide=open("/dev/hda",O_RDONLY);
(void)ioctl(ide,HDIO_GET_IDENTITY,&hd);
(void)printf("Serial number - %s\n",hd.serial_no);

this is working fine..but for sata hard disk it is not working how 
to change the code to get SATA hard disk serial number....i 
changed "/dev/hda" to "dev/sda" that is also not working

* For M2 Centres we know they must be network enabled. So use MAC addy +
  the IP address. Hash that with MD5 and go from there.

* Use the timestamp (date/time) of the /bin or C:\Windows or C:\WINNT directory.
  Convert it to seconds since 1970-01-01.

* Use MAC address, MD5 it, then grab 32bits of that.

* Total installed memory. Linux: /proc/meminfo -> MemTotal

* Check partitions on system: Linux: /proc/partitions

* CPU info.
